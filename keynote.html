                    <span>Abstract:</span> Computing is being transformed into a model consisting of services that are delivered in a manner similar to utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and telephony. In such a model, users access services based on their requirements without regard to where the services are hosted or how they are delivered. The Cloud computing paradigm has turned this vision of “computing utilities” into a reality. It offers infrastructure, platform, and software as services, which are made available to consumers as subscription-oriented services. Cloud application platforms need to offer (1) APIs and tools for the rapid creation of elastic applications and (2) a runtime system for the deployment of applications on geographically distributed Data Centre infrastructures (with Quantum computing nodes) in a seamless manner.

                  <span>Abstract:</span> The talk will explore a quick overview of UAVs followed by an introduction to aerial IoT networks. This will include different UAV application areas, types of UAV networks, and the common usage of UAVs. As data is an important aspect and often a deciding factor for most IoT architectures and networks, we discuss strategies to handle data within these UAV networks. We use three specific use cases of certain scenarios of data handling concerning reducing network data traffic, selection of appropriate aerial network routing paths, and distributed handling of the data within the aerial network. This becomes important, especially considering most current aerial IoT network attempts are still constrained in terms of resources, energy, and computing.

                  <span>Abstract:</span> 
                  Industry 4.0 relies on efficient network operations among others. In this context, Intent-based Networks (IBNs) present a great opportunity. In IBNs, users specify their intended operations using high-level instructions, based on which appropriate actions are taken. Consequently, IBNs can potentially reduce network management costs and effort, as well as improve efficiency. In this talk, we will discuss the design of a typical IBN by considering several intents corresponding to different network operations. Subsequently, we will look at how Artificial Intelligence can be used to map these intents into concrete actions and trigger such actions. We will conclude this talk by reviewing the performance of our IBN prototype and discussing some potential application scenarios.

                  <span>Abstract:</span> 
                  The emergence of wireless power transfer (WPT) technologies has enabled mobile and portable devices to be charged wirelessly without depending on cables, so as to continue executing their applications seamlessly. Typically, these devices can be charged wirelessly from different types of power sources such as wireless charging pads and mobile charging vehicles. In this regard, the use of peer-to-peer (P2P) WPT methods empowers a mobile device to recharge by directly interacting and exchanging energy with nearby mobile devices, thereby providing the flexibility to leverage the nearby peer power sources while maintaining their own mobility. Also, the P2P mode of WPT provides a cost-effective alternative solution suitable in cases of constrained environments, where external chargers might not be available. In our current research, our objective is to achieve an energy balancing of the network such that the average network energy is maximized while mitigating various challenges associated with the interaction among the deployed nodes.

                  <span>Abstract:</span>  DevOps is the amalgamation of two key divisions of the IT industry – Development and Operations which is a major paradigm shift in the domain of software engineering. It is a conceptual framework designed for the process of reintegrating software development, its delivery, and associated operations which were separate silos traditionally. DevOp is not merely a team; it is a culture of automation, information sharing, collaboration, measurement, and web service usage. The Organization’s performance from a development as well as operations point of view is boosted by DevOp operations. Especially performance in the sector of quality assurance and web service, a positive effect is observed. It refers to the practices followed in the organization with an intention towards the reducing of time-gap that is observed between changes committed to a system till that change is reflected in production with quality assurance.
